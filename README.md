# Semester-Project-2

For this Assignment I was instructed to create an auction website where users can create and upload listing that other users can bid on.

I created a simple website where a user can register an account, and log in. Once a user is logged in they can view listings that other people have uploaded.
The user can click on a listing to see the bids other users have placed, and they can place a bid themselves. When a new user sign up, they start of with 1000 credits, that they can use to bid on listings with.

Guest users who are not logged in can also view the listings, but they cannot bid.

In order to log in the user must provide a email adress ending with @stud.noroff.no

To run this application locally, you can download the zip file of the repostitory and run locally on you computer. I reccommend using the Live Server plug in on VS Code.
